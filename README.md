# CompDash (Android Project)

Hi everybody. How are you guys? May you always be in good health and of course always be blessed by God!

I want to showcase my mobile app project developed with XML Layout.

This application actually only contains a simple dashboard created case study for online learning.

### CompDash - About

The application or project this time I named MovApps. My goal for developing this Native-based mobile application is to improve my understanding of how to develop and create a program with Android Studio.

### CompDash - Technology

For the technology from the MovApps project, I developed it with several components, namely:

- Android Studio
- Java SDK v. 8
- Android SDK v. 31

### CompDash - Credit

For inspiration from working on the MovApps project that I developed, it came from a youtube channel called [Free resources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_9KP4dDz-Y&t=338s) which discusses how to make a mobile application simple dashboard project.

### CompDash - Open Source

For those of you who want to develop this CompDash application even better, I invite you with a note that your goals are for good. In addition, if you really want to make this application commercial, please contact me.
